## Hello friends!

#### I'm Andrew, a software engineer and former special educator/behavior analyst. The overall purpose of this blog is for me to practice technical writing and [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public). But first, I wanted to take a moment to refect on the journey that got me here.

#### I've always had a strong desire to help people, and it was this desire that led me to Special Education. I could see very tangible impacts of my work when a student increased their ability to communicate, gained more social skills, etc. As I learned more, the data-driven science of Applied Behavior Analysis became a focus for me, and I eventually earned a Master's degree in that specialty. I worked for a few years as a Behavior Analyst, but began to feel like I needed to make a change.

#### I enrolled at the [Turing School](https://turing.edu/) and studied Back End Engineering using Ruby on Rails. My time at Turing was incredible - an absolute blast, and simultaneously one of the hardest things I've ever done. Was the end result worth those late nights trying to get my tests to pass? **Absolutely.** Now I use the power of software to help people, but I work from home and am better able to support my family.
